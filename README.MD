# Anti-Adblock Killer Continued

![header](images/header.png)

### Let's revive our beloved Anti-Adblock Killer! 

# Initial Stage: Searching for core developers! 

### This project is not yet ready to serve, we are still looking for core developers who can make this possible. 

Do you want to help? Please head over to Issues page and let me know! 

TODO: 

1. Create filter list subscription portal, and fix broken links (I do not want to rely on original AAK pages)
2. Patch Userscript vulnerabilities and break it into two parts so community rules can be inserted in between
3. Make compilers so community rules can be nicely and safely compiled

## Instruction

#### Are you using Chrome, uBlock Origin, and Violentmonkey? Check out [AdBlock Protector](https://github.com/jspenguin2017/AdBlockProtector)!

## We need your help! 

This is a Merge Request driven community effort to bring back our beloved Anti-Adblock Killer. 

Every new solution are required to be "stand alone", so every part of this project can work alone. 
I realized that the solutions won't be complete this way, but it is better than causing more breakage due to partial installation. 

Please make resonable effort to make Userscript rules compatible with Greasemonkey. 

Code submitted to Merge Request will go over minimal review before being merged, your requestes will be processed fast. 

Are you a reputable developer who code a lot and want to directly write to the repository? Let me know and I will give you write access. 
Some critical files are protected (locked) and you must ask me to change them (open an issue).
